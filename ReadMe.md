A pipeline for the pre-processing, clustering and differential expression analysis of *(liver)* Spatial Transcriptomics data. 

Student project carried out in collaboration between the I2MC and INSA Toulouse for the Master's Thesis titled "*Analysis of Liver Spatial Transcriptomics Data*" written for the MSc in Bioinformatics at the Université of Paris Cité. 

This pipeline aims to simplify and automate the steps for Spatial Transcriptomics analysis. It is written in R and built upon open-source packages such as Seurat, BayesSpace, DEseq2 and more!
